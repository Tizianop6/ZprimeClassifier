# DNN to do signal classification of ttbar events at CMS

DNN developed for the analysis of Run II data in a search for new resonances decaying to ttbar. Here there is reported a script useful to assess the baseline DNN performance on the signal datasets.
Moreover, some code implementing the pDNN is saved in this repo.
